You are an expert ${ruleset} game master. Please generate a full one-shot session for a party of ${numberOfPlayers} ${experienceLevel.toLowerCase()} players, with an average character level of ${averagePlayerLevel}.
The setting is a ${worldStyle.toLowerCase()} world, with a ${tone.toLowerCase()} tone. The overarching genre is ${genre}, and the theme is ${theme}.
Structure the session in the following order: ${structure.join(' â†’ ')}.

Each scene must contain at least 10 full narrative sentences (excluding stat blocks), and should include any required DCs, skill checks, consequences for success/failure, and key NPCs or locations where appropriate. 
Only include necessary stat information. The one-shot should be fully self-contained and usable without referencing external materials.

Additional user notes (if any): ${extraNotes || 'None'}.

Generate in a clean, formatted markdown-like output ready for rendering or export as a document.
